    E) CHANGE IN NEW YORK CENTER OCEANIC CLEARANCE PROCEDURES
    BEGINNING ON 5 FEBRUARY 2013 AT 1200Z, NEW YORK CENTER WILL MODIFY
    THE PROCEDURES THAT ARE USED TO ISSUE OCEANIC CLEARANCES TO
    EASTBOUND AIRCRAFT ENTERING MINIMUM NAVIGATION PERFORMANCE STANDARD
    (MNPS) AIRSPACE. THESE PROCEDURES ONLY APPLY TO AIRCRAFT ENTERING
    THE NEW YORK CENTER OCEANIC CTA FROM A FAA FACILITY. THE PURPOSE OF
    THIS NOTAM IS TO EXPLAIN THESE CHANGES.
    NORTH ATLANTIC (NAT) DOCUMENT 007, TITLED GUIDANCE CONCERNING AIR
    NAVIGATION IN AND ABOVE THE NORTH ATLANTIC MNPS AIRSPACE IS A
    GUIDANCE DOCUMENT PUBLISHED BY ICAO TO ASSIST USERS IN THE PROPER
    PROCEDURES TO BE USED WHEN OPERATING IN THE NAT. CHAPTER 5 OF
    DOCUMENT 007, TITLED OCEANIC ATC CLEARANCES, IS THE CHAPTER TO WHICH
    THESE CHANGES PERTAIN.
    THERE ARE THREE COMPONENTS TO AN OCEANIC CLEARANCE. THEY ARE ROUTE,
    ALTITUDE AND SPEED. IT IS THE DELIVERY METHOD OF THESE THREE
    COMPONENTS WHICH IS CHANGING. BEGINNING ON 5 FEBRUARY 2013, THE FAA
    WILL CONSIDER THE AIRPORT CLEARANCE WHICH AN AIRCRAFT RECEIVES ON
    THE GROUND AT ITS DEPARTURE AERODROME TO BE THE ROUTE PORTION OF THE
    OCEANIC CLEARANCE. ALTITUDE AND SPEED ASSIGNMENT WILL OCCUR PRIOR TO
    ENTRY INTO THE NEW YORK CENTER OCEANIC CTA. AS IS THE CURRENT
    OPERATING PROCEDURE, UNSOLICITED EN-ROUTE ROUTE, ALTITUDE OR SPEED
    CHANGES MAY OCCUR DUE TO CHANGING TRAFFIC SITUATIONS. AT ALL TIMES,
    THE LAST ASSIGNED ROUTE, ALTITUDE AND SPEED ARE TO BE MAINTAINED AND
    SHOULD BE CONSIDERED YOUR NEW OCEANIC PROFILE. HAVING RECEIVED ALL
    THREE COMPONENTS, THE REQUIREMENT TO RECEIVE AN OCEANIC CLEARANCE
    WILL HAVE BEEN MET.
    FOR EXAMPLE:
    AN AIRCRAFT HAS FILED AN FPL FROM MDSD TO EDDF. THIS WOULD TAKE THE
    FLIGHT FROM THE SANTO DOMINGO FIR, THROUGH THE MIAMI FIR AND THEN
    THE NEW YORK FIR BEFORE ENTERING SANTA MARIA. THE AIRPORT CLEARANCE
    PROVIDED ON THE GROUND AT MDSD WOULD FULFILL THE ROUTE REQUIREMENT
    OF THE OCEANIC CLEARANCE. ONCE AIRBORNE AND IN THE MIAMI FIR, FINAL
    SPEED AND ALTITUDE ASSIGNMENT WILL BE GIVEN AFTER THE FLIGHT IS
    COORDINATED BETWEEN MIAMI AND NEW YORK.
    IF A ROUTE, SPEED OR ALTITUDE CHANGE EN-ROUTE IS DESIRED, THEN
    AIRCRAFT SHOULD MAKE A REQUEST FROM THE ATC UNIT IN WHICH THEY ARE
    OPERATING. AT ALL TIMES, THE LAST ASSIGNED ROUTE, ALTITUDE AND SPEED
    ARE TO BE MAINTAINED.
    TRACK MESSAGE IDENTIFICATION NUMBER (TMI) CONFIRMATION FOR AIRCRAFT
    FILING AN ABBREVIATED CLEARANCE IN LIEU OF THE TRACK COORDINATES
    WILL BE ACCOMPLISHED PRIOR TO REACHING THE TRACK ENTRY POINT.
    USERS ARE REMINDED OF THE REQUIREMENT TO FILE AN FPL AND ANY
    SUBSEQUENT CHANGES WITH NEW YORK OCEANIC AT KZWYZOZX, ALONG WITH ANY
    OTHER ATC FACILITIES THAT MAY REQUIRE SUCH FILING.
